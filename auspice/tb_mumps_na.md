### Mumps outbreaks in North America

Recently mumps has seen a resurgence around the world.
This narrative aims to provide a high level overview of the situation as observed by available genomes.

### Sparse occurrences before 2015

Prior to 2015, few mumps genomes were available, and the long branches don't support the presence of outbreaks.

### Outbreaks in Massachusetts

Sequenced genomes indicate multiple unconnected outbreaks in Massachusetts.
The earliest and largest seems to have started as 2015 came to a close (represented by 74 genomes).
Two smaller clades are present, originating in late 2015 and mid 2016, however the longer branches could indicate that these are not the result of within-Massachusetts transmission.

### Outbreaks in British Columbia

The genomes taken from the first wave of mumps cases in 2016 indicate a recently expanded clade unrelated to any others (with genomes that is!).

### Genomes from Washington and Arkansas

This clade of 30 genomes have longer branches than those from BC implying that this clade is representative of a much larger clade than appears here.

`nextstrain url=www.nextstrain.org/mumps/na?c=gt-SH_22`
### SH gene

The diversity in the SH gene is extremely limited, and unable to accurately distinguish between outbreaks.
Most other mutations present in SH divide the data into the clusters shown here.
